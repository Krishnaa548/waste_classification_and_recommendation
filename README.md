A machine learning system that analyzes waste images to classify materials and provide actionable recycling/disposal recommendations, deployed via MLOps best practices.

## 📌 Overview

This project combines computer vision and MLOps to automate waste segregation and promote sustainable practices. The system:
1. **Classifies waste types** (e.g., plastic, glass, organic) from user-uploaded images using a CNN model.
2. **Recommends recycling methods** based on local municipal guidelines and material type.
3. **Integrates with municipal APIs** to track resolution status and update waste management databases.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Image Analysis Pipeline**  
  - Pretrained ResNet50/VGG16 models fine-tuned on waste classification datasets.
  - Supports multi-label classification for composite waste items.
- **Recommendation Engine**  
  - Matches classified waste types with recycling centers, upcycling ideas, and disposal protocols using rule-based and NLP systems.
- **MLOps Infrastructure**  
  - Dockerized inference API with FastAPI.
  - Experiment tracking via MLflow.
  - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
  - Monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana for model drift detection.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **ML Frameworks**: TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, OpenCV
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Flask
- **MLOps**: Docker, MLflow, DVC (Data Version Control), GitHub Actions
- **Cloud**: AWS S3 (model storage), EC2 (deployment)
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana

## 🖥️ Installation

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/waste-mgmt-ai.git
   cd waste-mgmt-ai

2.**Set up a virtual environment**:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

3.**Run the Dockerized API**:
docker build -t waste-classifier .
docker run -p 8000:8000 waste-classifier

🧪 Usage
1. Model Inference
Classify waste from an image:
import requests

url = "http://localhost:8000/predict"
files = {'file': open('test_image.jpg', 'rb')}
response = requests.post(url, files=files)
print(response.json())
# Output: {"class": "plastic", "confidence": 0.92, "recommendations": ["Recycle at Zone-5 Center", "Upcycle: DIY storage containers"]}

2. Training Pipeline
Retrain the model with new data:
python src/training/train.py --data_path=data/processed --epochs=20

3. Monitoring Dashboard
Access Grafana at http://localhost:3000 to track model performance metrics.
